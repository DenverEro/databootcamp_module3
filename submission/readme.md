# Python Challenges: PyBank and PyPoll

## Background

This project challenges the data analyst student to put their Python scripting skills to use by analyzing real-world data. You will work on two separate challenges, **PyBank** and **PyPoll**, each presenting a unique scenario where you need to extract and analyze data using Python scripts.

## PyBank Instructions

The **PyBank** challenge requires you to analyze your company's financial records using the provided dataset `budget_data.csv`. 

### Objectives

Create a Python script that performs the following:

1. Calculate the **total number of months** included in the dataset.
2. Calculate the **net total amount of "Profit/Losses"** over the entire period.
3. Calculate the **changes in "Profit/Losses"** over the entire period, and find the **average** of those changes.
4. Identify the **greatest increase in profits** (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. Identify the **greatest decrease in profits** (date and amount) over the entire period.

## PyPoll Instructions

The **PyPoll** challenge involves helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process using the provided dataset `election_data.csv`. The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Voter ID**
- **County**
- **Candidate**
